This directory contains a simple python script, which generates data (JSON) to feed an algorithm.

Furthermore, this project utilizes poetry to manage dependencies.
Therefore, you may first install poetry (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/poetry.html)
and then the dependencies with `poetry install`

Afterwards, you can run the script with `poetry run python main.py`
