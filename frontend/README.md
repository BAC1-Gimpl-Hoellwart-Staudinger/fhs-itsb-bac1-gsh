> A React application for local dataset generation, algorithmic scheduling, calendar visualization and integrated statistics.

This application was initially generated using `npx create-react-app` (https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Make sure, that the backend of this project is already running, because several requests are conducted to obtain data.

## Installation
To launch the application, begin by installing the essential dependencies with the following command: `npm install --save`.

Once the dependencies are installed, you can utilize the scripts provided by create-react-app:
- To start the application: `npm start`
- To run tests: `npm test`
- To build the application: `npm build`
